1. Starting regtest mode:

Open a terminal and navigate to your Bitcoin Core directory.
Run the following command to start a Bitcoin Core node in regtest mode:

bitcoind -regtest -daemon

This will create a separate data directory for your regtest blockchain.


2. Generating addresses:

You'll need addresses to send and receive bitcoins in your regtest network.
Use this command to generate a new address:

bitcoin-cli -regtest getnewaddress
This will provide you with a new Bitcoin address you can use for transactions.

3. Generating blocks (mining):

In regtest mode, you can generate blocks yourself to confirm transactions and earn testnet coins.

There are a few ways to do this:

Generate a specific number of blocks to an address:
bitcoin-cli -regtest generatetoaddress <number_of_blocks> <your_address>
* Generate until a specific coinbase reward is reached:
bitcoin-cli -regtest generate <number_of_coins>
4. Checking information:

Get information about the blockchain:
bitcoin-cli -regtest getblockcount
This will display the current number of blocks in your regtest chain.

Get information about a specific block:
bitcoin-cli -regtest getblock <block_hash>
Replace <block_hash> with the actual hash of the block you want to see details about.

Get information about your wallet:
bitcoin-cli -regtest getwalletinfo
This will display details about your regtest wallet, including its balance.

5. Sending and receiving bitcoins:

Send bitcoins to another address:
bitcoin-cli -regtest sendtoaddress <destination_address> <amount>
Replace <destination_address> with the recipient's address and <amount> with the amount of bitcoins you want to send.
